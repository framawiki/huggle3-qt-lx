Huggle is a fast diff browser application intended for dealing with vandalism or other unconstructive edits on Wikimedia projects, written in C++. Anyone can download Huggle, but rollback permission is required to use it in unrestricted mode on English Wikipedia.

Huggle is able to load and review edits made to Wikipedia in real time, helps users identify unconstructive edits, and allows them to be reverted quickly. Various mechanisms are used to draw conclusions to whether an edit is constructive or not. It uses a semi-distributed model where edits are retrieved using a "provider" (this can be anything that is capable of distributing a stream of edit information, such as the Wikipedia API or IRC recent changes feed), pre-parsed and analyzed. This information is then shared with other anti-vandalism tools, such as ClueBot NG. Huggle also uses a number of self-learning mechanisms, including a global white-list (users that are considered trusted) and user-badness scores that are stored locally on the client's computer.
