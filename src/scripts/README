This folder contains default scripts that are shipped with huggle.

Huggle supports 2 types of scripts:

* core scripts: loaded by huggle core, support only low level functions and hooks, compatible with anything descending from core, like bots.
* ui scripts:  loaded by desktop huggle, support Qt UI functions, compatible with Huggle only.

By default Huggle (desktop version) loads all scripts as ui scripts
