Thank you for contributing to Wikipedia, 208.68.153.177! However, your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Revolutionary_War&diff=118555542&oldid=118431416 here] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove [[WP:SPAM|spam]] from Wikipedia.

Please read [[WP:EL|Wikipedia's external links policy]] for more information. If the link was to an image, please read [[WP:IMAGE|Wikipedia's image tutorial]] on how to use a more appropriate method to insert the image into an article. If your link was intended to promote a site you own, are affiliated with, or will make money from inclusion in Wikipedia, please note that inserting spam into Wikipedia is against policy.
