[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Josve05a|Josve05a]]. I noticed that you recently removed some content from [[:NBC]],&nbsp;with <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NBC&diff=590404503 this edit]<span>, without explaining why. In the future, it would be helpful to others if you described your changes to Wikipedia with an [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summary]]. If this was a mistake, don't worry, the removed content has been restored. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Josve05a|my talk page]]. Thanks. <!-- Template:Huggle/warn-delete-1 --><!-- Template:uw-delete1 --><span style="background: turquoise"><span style="font-family:'Segoe Script'">([[User talk:Josve05a|'''t''']])&nbsp;[[User:Josve05a|<span style="color:white;">'''Josve05a'''</span>]]&nbsp;([[Special:Contributions/Josve05a|'''c''']]) </span></span> 20:06, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
