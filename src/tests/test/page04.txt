Between 1901 and 1902 the [[Cape Government Railways]] placed sixteen 8th Class [[2-8-0|{{nowrap|2-8-0}}]] Consolidation type [[steam locomotive]]s in service. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered and reclassified to '''Class 8X'''. One of them was later converted to a 4-8-0 Mastodon type wheel arrangement and reclassified to '''Class 8R'''.<ref name="Holland 1"/><ref name="SAR Renumber"/>

The first locomotive in the Cape Government Railways (CGR) {{nowrap|2-8-0}} Consolidation type 8th Class was designed by H.M. Beatty, the Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CGR from 1896 to 1910, and sixteen were ordered from the [[Schenectady Locomotive Works]] in the United States. While they were being built, in 1901, Schenectady merged with seven other locomotive builders to form the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO).<ref name="Holland 1"/>

These sixteen {{nowrap|2-8-0}} locomotives were followed by several more orders, placed with various manufacturers, for similar locomotives for the CGR between 1902 and 1904. While subjecting these first sixteen locomotives to exhaustive testing on all types of traffic and under varying conditions, some trouble was experienced with the leading pony truck and it was dropped in favour of a four wheeled bogie in later orders for more locomotives. Most of the later locomotives were therefore built with a 4-8-0 Mastodon type wheel arrangement, but in spite of the difference they were all grouped together into 8th Class by the CGR.<ref name="Holland 1"/><ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

The [[Union of South Africa]] was established on 31 May 1910, in terms of the South Africa Act. One of the clauses in the Act required that the three Colonial Government railways, the CGR, the [[Natal Government Railways]] and the [[Central South African Railways]], also be united under one single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. While the [[South African Railways]] (SAR) came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways required careful planning and was only implemented with {{nowrap|effect}} from 1 January 1912.<ref name="SAR Renumber"/><ref name="SAR History">''The South African Railways - Historical Survey''.

In 1930 one of the Class 8X locomotives, SAR 883, was reboilered with a purpose built boiler. At the same time it was superheated and converted to a 4-8-0 Mastodon type wheel arrangement by replacing the leading pony truck with a bogie.
