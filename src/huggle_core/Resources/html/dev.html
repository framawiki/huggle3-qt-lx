      <h1>Developer mode</h1>
    </center>
    <p>Welcome to developer mode: this is a special mode of run intended for Developers, so they can bypass the lengthy login process.</p>
    <p>This is very useful when you are working on stuff like Huggle UI or scripting some extension that doesn't really use most of Huggle's features. When you are in the developer mode, you won't be able to perform any edits with Huggle. It's completely read only and most functionalities are limited. The configuration file for project is not loaded from wiki, but using the built-in default only, therefore this mode is not ideal for testing of configuration changes.</p>
    <p><b>Recent changes stream is disabled, so huggle is doing nothing now, you have to enable it by hand in System menu in order for Huggle to start operating.</b></p>
