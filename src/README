Huggle source code layout
================================

Huggle since version 3.4.0 is divided to separate parts for greater modularity,
these parts together with other libraries are located in this folder.

* 3rd:         3rd party libraries provided by projects unaffiliated to Huggle
* build:       various tools and scripts
* huggle_core: Huggle core - all the Huggle internals, mostly independent on UI
* huggle_ui:   Qt UI for Desktop Huggle version
* huggle_l10n: Localization files
* huggle_res:  Non-critical resources (sounds, icons, etc)
* huggle:      Simple executable used to launch Huggle
* extensions:  Extensions to huggle
* scripts:     JS extensions

The reasons for this layout are availability of Huggle's core to other projects,
like mediawiki bots, or different Huggle UI's (like mobile phone UI).

It's also necessary in order to make it easily and efficiently possible for
binary extensions to link against the huggle's core and interface.
